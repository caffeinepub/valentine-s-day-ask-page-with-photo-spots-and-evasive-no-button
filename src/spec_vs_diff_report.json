  "summary": "The diff removes PhotoSlot imports from the visible portions of PostYesMovieDatePage and ValentineAskPage and replaces the movie-date photo area with a static poster/details layout. However, PhotoSlot.tsx is still present and described as a full upload component, and the diff also appears to introduce/describe additional \"evasive No button\" behavior that was not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Remove or retire the PhotoSlot component so it is not used anywhere in the frontend build (delete the file if unused, or leave it but ensure there are no imports/usages).",
      "reason": "The diff shows PhotoSlot.tsx still exists and is described as an active upload component; the provided diff summary does not provide evidence that there are zero remaining imports/usages across the entire codebase.",

      "description": "New/changed behavior where the \"No\" button is evasive and cannot be clicked/tapped/keyboard-activated (moves on interaction).",
